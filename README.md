# STM32_basic

This repo contains very basic level usage of the ARM based STM32F46RE uC.
I have done register level programming from scratch and implement most of the functionalites myself(except ofcourse the startup code and the syscalls !!)
All the projects sorce codes here are very well documented, still if u have any problem/criticism I welcome them with grace. 
Star this repo for more updates and projects!!
